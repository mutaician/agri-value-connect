**AgriValue Connect: Core Concept**

*   **Primary Goal:** Reduce post-harvest losses and improve market access for farmers with perishable goods by connecting them with buyers and facilitating timely sales, including discounted offers for produce nearing its sell-by date.



**MVP Feature Set for "AgriValue Connect":**


1.  **User Registration/Profiles:** Simple email/password or phone number registration for Farmers and Buyers.
    *   Farmers: Name, general location (e.g., county/sub-county), types of crops they usually grow.
    *   Buyers: Name, type of buyer (individual, vendor, restaurant).
2.  **Farmer - Create Listing:**
    *   Crop type (dropdown/autocomplete).
    *   Quantity available.
    *   Harvest date.
    *   "Sell-by" or "Best-before" date (farmer estimates).
    *   Initial price.
    *   Location/Preferred meeting point (text input, or dropdown of major markets if time allows).
    *   Photo upload (important for produce!).
3.  **Buyer - Browse & Search Listings:**
    *   Search by crop type.
    *   Filter by general location (e.g., county).
    *   Sort by "nearing sell-by date" or "newly listed."
    *   View listing details (farmer info, crop details, price, location).
4.  **Dynamic Discounting (Simple Logic):**
    *   If a listing is X days from its "sell-by" date and still active, automatically display a "Suggested Discount" or a "Hot Deal!" badge. Farmer can choose to accept the suggested new price or set their own.
5.  **Basic Chat Functionality:**
    *   A "Contact Farmer" or "Make Offer" button on listings.
    *   This opens a simple 1-to-1 chat interface between the buyer and that specific farmer for that listing.
    *   Store chat messages in a database.
6.  **Notifications (Simplified):**
    *   In-app notifications for farmers when a buyer messages them.
    *   In-app notifications for buyers if a farmer responds. (Email/SMS notifications future implementation).
